    "description": "Stolovi is a mountain in Serbia, southwest of Kraljevo, between the Ibar, Ribnica and Brezanska rivers. The tributaries of the mentioned rivers diverge from it in all directions, which split the mountain into long ridges and slopes with deep valleys and gave it a star shape as a whole. Tables descend in a star-like manner from the peaks to the neighboring smaller mountains, Ozren (959 m), Vitoš (755 m), Oštra glava (729 m), Strmenica (678 m) and others. The main mountain ridge is in the north-northwest-south-southeast direction. The highest peak of the Stolovi mountain is Kamarište, 1375 m above sea level, some call it Ravni sto, because of the plateau on top. Usovica is often mentioned as the highest peak, but Usovica is only a ridge that leads to Čiker peak (1325 m), which is the second highest peak of Stolov. Other higher peaks of Stolov towards the Ibra valley are Mala Čuka (1151 m), Velika Čuka (1030 m), Orlovac (938 m), and Čukar (1020 m), Tepak (1020 m), Klečak (871 m) are higher peaks towards Ribnica valley."
